  * Step-by-Step Vocabulary Teaching Procedure:
    + Step 1 (Visual Elicitation): Hold up flashcards or display clear digital slides one by one. Elicit words from students using gestures.
    + Step 2 (Native Modeling): Pronounce each word 3 times clearly with natural intonation and distinct ending sounds. Play native audio tracks.
    + Step 3 (Articulation Coaching): Guide mouth shape, tongue placement, and airflow for challenging sounds: ${matchedUnit.phonics}.
    + Step 4 (Concept Checking Questions - CCQs): Ask quick checking questions to verify 100% student comprehension of meanings and context.
    + Step 5 (Multi-Tiered Drilling): Direct whole-class choral repetition, group drilling (row by row), and individual checks; correct errors immediately.

- PRESENTATION OF SENTENCE PATTERNS:
  * Core Sentence Structures:

    + Level 1 (Choral): Entire class repeats each word clearly 2-3 times.
    + Level 2 (Group): Rows and groups take turns pronouncing words aloud in friendly competition.
    + Level 3 (Individual): Individual students stand up, pronounce target words, and receive teacher's feedback on ending sounds.
  * Point to the pictures in the Student's Book and say the words aloud (Point and Say).
  * Write the new vocabulary neatly into English notebooks with phonetic guides.

- SENTENCE PATTERN ACQUISITION:

    + Call out a word or show an action; representatives from both teams race to tap the correct card and pronounce it loudly.
    + Award points, praise fast reflexes, and correct pronunciation gently.

- GUIDED PAIR-WORK PRACTICE:
  * Instruct students to work in pairs (Student A & Student B) using the target sentence pattern:
${matchedUnit.sentencePatterns.map((p) => `    > ${p}`).join("\n")}

- COMMUNICATIVE PAIR-WORK PRACTICE:
  * Student A: Point to the flashcard and ask using the target question pattern.
  * Student B: Look at the visual clue, answer accurately using the target vocabulary.
  * Swap roles so both partners practice asking and answering with all target words.
  * Give gentle feedback to partners on ending sounds and pronunciation.`;

  * Ask students to choose 2 target words and use them in a real-world sentence about themselves.
  * Provide a clear speaking frame on the board.
  * Invite several students to share their sentences with the class; give positive praise and formative assessment.
- Lesson Wrap-up & Homework:
  * Summarize target words and sentence patterns learned today.
  * Homework: Practice pronouncing the words at home, write each word 2 lines, and prepare for Lesson 2.`;
